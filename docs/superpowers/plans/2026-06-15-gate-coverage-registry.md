# Gate-coverage registry — BOARD (Phase-0 deliverable F26)

> **Generated**: 2026-06-15 · **HEAD at build**: `85638dcd0fa44bece18c285cd6c4501e1d0a3c19`
> **Binding plan**: [`2026-06-15-end-to-end-master-plan-to-100-v2.md`](./2026-06-15-end-to-end-master-plan-to-100-v2.md) · **Binding spec**: [`2026-06-11-one-pass-digestion-teaching-engine-design.md`](../specs/2026-06-11-one-pass-digestion-teaching-engine-design.md)
> **Machine-readable source of truth**: [`2026-06-15-gate-coverage-registry.json`](./2026-06-15-gate-coverage-registry.json) (this board is generated FROM it; the checker `tools/gate-registry-check.mjs` parses the JSON, never this MD).

This is the **status+tag-stamped registry** the plan calls for (§2 `gate-COVERAGE` invariant, line 87; Phase-0 EXIT "coverage registry complete, zero UNMAPPED", line 117). Every spec clause / INV-* + every named non-INV gate clause is enumerated with its **LAYER**, **TAG**, **STATUS**, **backing gate**, and **evidence**. Nothing is UNMAPPED; nothing is silently absorbed.

## How to read this board

**LAYER** — *where the clause lives* (enum `L1 | L2 | SYS`):
- **L1 — TRUTH**: course facts (defn · theorem · method · derivation · complexity · code). Default gate KIND = **PROOF**.
- **L2 — TEACHING**: scaffolding (framing · figure · analogy · predict→reveal · plain words). Default gate KIND = **ESTIMATOR**.
- **SYS**: system/pipeline plumbing (ingest · classify · migrate · schedule · state). Decidable structural invariants.

**TAG** — *what KIND of gate is owed* (enum `PROOF | ESTIMATOR`). **LAYER and TAG are TWO INDEPENDENT stamps** — the TAG is derived per-clause from the spec text, **not** mechanically read off the LAYER (plan §0.1):
- **PROOF** — a hard **decidable** gate MUST back it. An estimator / `neverificat` lane backing a PROOF clause = **RED on coverage** (audit F43). The checker enforces this.
- **ESTIMATOR** — an estimator + `neverificat` / `verifică sursa` fallback is legitimate; the gate may **never** wear a PROOF / "provably" / "GATE-OF-GATES" label, and the residual is **named on the board**.

The deliberate counter-examples (LAYER ≠ default TAG): **dim-12 language = L2 · PROOF** (decidable RO-ness); **dim-13 depth = L1 · split** (code-compiles leg PROOF; complexity/invariant/edge legs ESTIMATOR → `verifică sursa`); **dim-14 pedagogy = L2 · split** (binding/non-paraphrase/ATTEMPT-precedes legs PROOF; separates-models leg the canonical L2 · ESTIMATOR).

**STATUS** (enum `LIVE-GREEN | PLANNED | RED-UNMAPPED`):
- **LIVE-GREEN** — a CI gate backs the invariant **today**. Scoped to today’s corpus reality: many are green on the **seeded ~PA corpus** / the **3 tracked viz families**; per-row NOTEs flag where full-corpus coverage is still PLANNED (Phase-0 EXIT is explicit: self-test-green proves **liveness**, not **coverage**).
- **PLANNED** — registered with a known backing-gate target; not yet built/gated. Honest non-overclaim.
- **RED-UNMAPPED** — **no effective live gate today** AND either it is a flagged debt cell (in the accepted-debt allow-list) or a non-decidable process control. **RED-UNMAPPED rows are listed in the SECURITY-DEBT / DEBT section below with a named owner — never folded into the green count.**

## Counts summary

| status | count |
|---|---:|
| **LIVE-GREEN** | **18** |
| **PLANNED** | **62** |
| **RED-UNMAPPED** | **6** |
| **TOTAL** | **86** |

`#LIVE-GREEN / #PLANNED / #RED-UNMAPPED = 21 / 59 / 6` (total 86). _(AMENDMENT 2026-06-20: +2 LIVE-GREEN — Phase0-RelayRetryBackoff + Phase0-StateCacheIsolation flipped PLANNED→LIVE-GREEN, both DONE in code with `gradle :check` backing.)_

**Zero UNMAPPED** (every row carries a layer + tag + status) and **zero unaccounted RED** (every RED-UNMAPPED id is in the accepted-debt allow-list). Machine-verified by `node tools/gate-registry-check.mjs` (exit 0).

## SECURITY-DEBT & FAIL-OPEN DEBT (the RED-UNMAPPED rows)

These 6 cells are **flagged debt with a named owner**. They are in the checker’s `acceptedDebt` allow-list (printed on every run) and are **NEVER laundered into the green count**. Two are true *security* debt (`auth-surface-security-debt`) / fail-open *enforcement* debt (`Phase0-Impeccable-blocking`); the rest are Linux-baseline / a11y / process debt. Any RED-UNMAPPED row that is **not** on this list fails the checker.

| id | status | tag | owner | residual / reason | never-green-until |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|---|---|
| `auth-surface-security-debt` | RED-UNMAPPED | PROOF | PM (Alex) — spec §A.3.1 #17 scopes auth OUT of the 100% target | CSRF-totality + cookie Secure/SameSite + session-fixation remain untested. A substantial auth suite exists in `gradle :check` (MagicLinkRepoTest/CsrfTest/AuthVerifyRouteTest/CrossTenantIsolationTest) but the named residual is real. Flagged cell, never laundered green. | the three residual classes get dedicated tests OR Alex explicitly re-scopes auth into the target |
| `Phase0-Impeccable-blocking` | RED-UNMAPPED | ESTIMATOR | Phase 0 (flip the `|| true` fail-open guard after calibration) | Impeccable runs fail-open (`npx impeccable@2.3.2 detect ... || true`, test.yml line 85); 25 real findings outstanding. Registered with a fail-open-debt note, NOT LIVE-GREEN. | Phase 0 calibrates the findings and drops the `|| true` guard (Phase-0 EXIT: Impeccable blocking-green) |
| `Phase0-LinuxVisualBaselines` | RED-UNMAPPED | ESTIMATOR | Phase 0 (Linux visual-baseline regeneration) | Baselines were Windows-only; CI runs Linux; the 3 visual specs are testIgnore'd / fail-open today. Visual baselining is a Linux gap until Phase 0 regenerates them. | Phase 0 regenerates Linux baselines (Phase-0 EXIT) |
| `INV-9.5` | RED-UNMAPPED | PROOF | Phase 0 (Linux baseline regen) + Phase D (dual-skin) | Visual baselines (shell/theme-dark/theme-light) are testIgnore'd (Linux gap, fail-open); no CI job asserts the baseline dir contains ONLY shell+2-themes. The INV-9.5 scope-gate is unenforced until the baselines are repaired and Phase D adds the dual-skin gate. | Phase 0 Linux-baseline regen + Phase D dual-skin EXIT |
| `Phase0-StandingRedTeam` | RED-UNMAPPED | ESTIMATOR | PM/council process discipline | Process step, not a CI gate (a human/council discipline: a defect class appearing twice = pipeline bug). Inherently not a decidable CI gate; registered, not machine-backed. | N/A — process control, displayed on the board, never claimed CI-green |
| `a11y-keyboard-aria-live-gate` | RED-UNMAPPED | ESTIMATOR | Phase D (Accessibility gate, audit F35) | No a11y gate today (the 5 axe tests disable color-contrast). Best-practice, NOT a spec clause — registered, not laundered as spec-compliance. | Phase D builds the keyboard-traversal + RO-aria-live gate (Phase-D EXIT) |

## The checker (`tools/gate-registry-check.mjs`)

```
node tools/gate-registry-check.mjs              # checks docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-gate-coverage-registry.json
node tools/gate-registry-check.mjs <path.json>  # check a fixture (used by the self-test)
```

Exits **1** (printing the offending rows) if ANY of:
- **(U) UNMAPPED** — a clause missing `status` / `tag` / `layer`, or a value outside the enum.
- **(R) UNACCOUNTED-RED** — a `RED-UNMAPPED` clause whose id is NOT in `acceptedDebt`.
- **(P) PROOF-BY-ESTIMATOR** — a `PROOF` clause marked `LIVE-GREEN` but backed only by an estimator / `neverificat` lane (or naming no real decidable gate). Audit F43.
- **(D) DUPLICATE-ID** — two clauses share an id.
- **(C) COUNTS-DRIFT** — the `counts` block disagrees with the actual array.
- **(A) ORPHAN-DEBT** — a stale `acceptedDebt` entry (no matching clause, or pointing at a non-RED clause).

Exits **0** only when the registry is internally consistent. The accepted-debt allow-list is **printed on every run** so debt is never silently absorbed. INV-9.4 self-test for this gate: `tools/gate-registry-check.test.mjs` (`node --test tools/gate-registry-check.test.mjs`) — feeds a seeded-bad registry (UNMAPPED + PROOF-by-estimator + duplicate + counts-drift + orphan-debt) and asserts the checker REDS, plus a clean fixture asserting exit 0.

> **✅ NOW CI-WIRED — AMENDMENT 2026-06-20:** the `gate-registry` job in `test.yml` runs `gate-registry-check.mjs` + its seeded-bad self-test (hard-blocking). _(Historical: this note predates the wiring; the CI job now exists.)_
